    <h2>History of Salmon Cookies</h2>
    <img src="img/chinook.jpg" alt="chinook salmon" title="chinook salmon">
    <p>Pat, the founder of salmon cookies, proposed the idea to make cookies with actual salmon inside them in 2000. Everybody at that time thought it was a horrible idea and would never work. Pat never gave up though; over the years he kept experiementing and baking. In 2015 he finally accomplished what he set out to do so long ago; he created a salmon cookie! These cookies have since been refined and Pat has not stopped working on creating better cookies since he believes there is always room for improvement.</p>
